PROJECT ARCHITECTURE



The server handles the truth (files and processes) and the browser handles the look (windows and animations).



THE BACKEND (THE BRIDGE) This runs on your real Linux device. It acts as the translator between your Web UI and the Linux Kernel. Language: Node.js Key Libraries: Express: To serve the initial web page. Socket.io: For the Real-Time connection. Node-pty: Creates a pseudo-terminal on the server to execute real commands. Chokidar: Monitors the file system for real-time updates.



THE FRONTEND (THE FAKE OS) This is what the user sees in the browser. It should look like XFCE. Language: TypeScript or React. Key Components: Window Manager: A system to handle dragging, resizing, and z-index for floating windows. Xterm.js: Renders the terminal output with support for colors and mouse events. Monaco Editor: Integrated code editor for file manipulation. State Management: Tracks open windows and active sessions.



6-PHASE MASTER ROADMAP



PHASE 1: THE HEARTBEAT (CONNECTION) Goal: Establish a secure, real-time link. Task: Setup an Express server and Socket.io. Function: The server identifies the device and confirms connection to the browser. Win: You have a stable communication bridge.



PHASE 2: THE NERVES (TERMINAL ACCESS SUPPORT) Goal: Full interactive terminal control. Task: Implement node-pty on the backend and Xterm.js on the frontend. Capability: Run bash, htop, vim, and python directly in the browser. Win: You gain 100 percent control of the device via the web terminal.



PHASE 3: THE SKELETON (DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT) Goal: Mimic the XFCE desktop experience. Task 1: Create a CSS-based Taskbar and Desktop workspace. Task 2: Build a Window Wrapper with minimize, maximize, and close logic. Task 3: Create an App Launcher (Whisker Menu) to trigger system tools. Win: The project feels like a Desktop OS rather than a website.



PHASE 4: THE EYES (FILE EXPLORER AND EDITOR) Goal: High-speed file manipulation. Task 1: Build a grid-based file explorer using JSON data from the server. Task 2: Integrate Monaco Editor for instant file editing. Win: Manage real device files with zero pixel-streaming lag.



PHASE 5: THE BRAIN (OPTIMIZATION AND PERSISTENCE) [COMPLETE] Goal: Ensure performance and stability. Task 1: Differential Updates to minimize data transfer. Task 2: Session Persistence to keep terminals running after browser refresh. Task 3: Theme support using CSS variables for custom styling. Win: FakeOS becomes a reliable, daily-driver remote interface.



PHASE 6: THE LAUNCHPAD (TUTORIAL AND DEPENDENCIES) [COMPLETE] Goal: Documentation and deployment. Dependencies: Install build-essential, python3, and make on the host. Commands: Use npm install for setup and node server.js to launch. Tutorial: Guide for connecting via IP and managing the headless environment. Win: Easy installation and clear usage instructions for the user.
